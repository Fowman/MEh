Hey guys in here you find a little turorial on how to use this Script and adapt it to your Server.

1. go into client.lua and look for line 13 to 34 and copy it completly.
2. go in line 36 as example and paste it.
3. rename 'PH_MapBlips:ShowBlippolice' to 'PH_MapBlips:ShowBlipYOURBLIPNAME' once you have done this follow the next steps.
4. Look for local Blips and Local MapOptions  by 'Something' add your Desired Blip Name.
5. Now for the Menu Stuff ( this can get a bit confusing but its easy when you did it once)
6. Copy from 126-143 and paste it below.
7. Rename 'police' from your recently pastet code to whatever you want.


For better visualisation i put a Tutorial into the script itself so you can see the steps better.
